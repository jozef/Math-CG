NAME

    Math::CG - Computational Geometry modules

SYNOPSIS

        use Math::CG::Point;
        use Math::CG::PointSet;
        use Math::CG::Triangle;

DESCRIPTION

    Started to learn 计算几何 | Computational Geometry via https://www.edx.org/
    and this set of modules is a result of trying out and excercising what
    I've learned so far. So really unstable for now.
