=head1 NAME

Math::CG - Computational Geometry modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Math::CG::Point;
    use Math::CG::PointSet;
    use Math::CG::Triangle;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Started to learn C<计算几何 | Computational Geometry> via L<https://www.edx.org/>
and this set of modules is a result of trying out and excercising what I've learned
so far. So really unstable for now.
